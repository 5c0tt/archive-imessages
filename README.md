iMessage will keep a store of all images, this script will copy all those images, make a timestamp, and on next run, only copy those newer than the time stamp.

There is a potential bug, look into the bug tracker, in that files are all in folders, but I am lumping them in one folder, so I should rename the files to have a serial number so they don't collide or get over-written.
